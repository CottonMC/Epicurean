Epicurean Gastronomy, or EpiGast, adds a few food-related features to Fabric for Minecraft 1.14. Included:

- Sweet Berries can be crafted from Jelly, and applied to foods to restore more hunger and saturation.
- Jelly can be crafted into Super Jelly, and applied to get a better restoration and temporary jump boost.
- Hoppers can harvest various crops by placing a hopper under the block they're growing on. (configurable, on by default)
    - For wheat-style crops, the hopper goes under the farmland the crop is on.
    - For pumpkin/melon-style crops, the hopper goes under the farmland the stem is on.
    - For cocoa beans, the hopper goes under the log the cocoa bean is on.
    - For sweet berries, the hopper goes under the grass/dirt the bush is on.
- Nether wart can be grown using bone meal.
- Cake can be eaten without being placed on the ground to restore a cake's worth of hunger at once.
    - Hold right-click in the air to do this, or it'll place down.
- Glistering melons can now be eaten to instantly recover one heart.
- Iron and gold nuggets can be eaten. (configurable, off by default)
    - Each have their own hunger and saturation restoration separate to the Omnivore feature (below) when this is active.
- Any block or item without a right-click-in-the-air action can be eaten. (configurable, off by default)
    - The amount of hunger and saturation gained is configurable and standard.
    - Items with durability will have a configurable amount of durability consumed instead of destroying the item instantly.
    - Eat TNT for a special surprise.
